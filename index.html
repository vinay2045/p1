To add an orange background color to the body, you need to add the following CSS rule to your `style.css` file:

```css
body {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

Make sure that  `style.css` is in the same directory as your HTML file.  If you have other styles affecting the body, you may need to adjust the specificity of this rule (e.g., using more specific selectors) to ensure it overrides them.  For example, if you had `body {background-color: blue;}` already, the orange would not show.  The above code will override any existing `body` styles.
