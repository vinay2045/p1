You are absolutely correct.  The provided instructions were contradictory.  The issue described requires modification to the `style.css` file, not `script.js`. Since no `script.js` content was provided, there is nothing to modify in `script.js` to address this issue.  Therefore, I cannot return an updated `script.js` file because no changes are needed or possible based on the problem statement.
