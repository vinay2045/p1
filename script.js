The provided code is JavaScript, not CSS.  The issue "add orange color to body in style.css" refers to modifying a CSS file, not the JavaScript file you've shown.  This JavaScript code handles the functionality of the to-do list, including drag-and-drop and form validation. It does *not* interact with the page's background color.

To add an orange background color, you still need to modify your `style.css` file (as explained in my previous response) by adding:

```css
body {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

This JavaScript code is unrelated to the CSS styling.  They are separate parts of the web page development.  The JavaScript controls the behavior, and the CSS controls the visual appearance.
