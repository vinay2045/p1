The provided CSS does *not* include a rule to set the `body` background color to orange. You need to add a rule similar to this to your `style.css` file:

```css
body {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

Place this rule at the beginning or end of your `style.css` file, or at a point in the file where it won't be overridden by other more specific rules.  Because this is a very general selector, other styles targeting more specific elements or using `!important` might take precedence.  If that happens, you might need to adjust the selector to be more precise or use `!important` in your `body` rule (though using `!important` is generally discouraged as it can make CSS harder to maintain).
